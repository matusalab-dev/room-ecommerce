### Additional Problems and Solutions

Customization Options

    Problem: Limited customization options can deter users who are looking for specific styles, colors, or sizes.
    Solution: Offer a customization tool where users can select different fabrics, colors, and finishes, and see a real-time preview of their custom furniture.

Delivery and Assembly Concerns

    Problem: Users are often concerned about the delivery time, costs, and the difficulty of assembling furniture.
    Solution: Provide detailed delivery options including estimated times and costs, and offer assembly services. Include clear assembly instructions or tutorial videos for users who prefer to do it themselves.

Product Reviews and Ratings

    Solution: Integrate a review and rating system where previous buyers can leave feedback on the products. Highlight top-rated products and respond to reviews to show active customer service.
